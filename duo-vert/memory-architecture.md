description: How this vault works, why curated notes over raw session dumps, and the real sync gap between Claude Code, Cowork, and claude.ai

**Setup (2026-07-30):** Emile migrated from an old computer to a new Mac, which surfaced that Claude Code's memory (`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`) is local to one machine, and separate from Cowork's own skill storage and claude.ai's memory feature — three disconnected stores. Also discovered `duovert-site-fixed` (the actual website source files) never made it to the new Mac — resolved 2026-08-01, see the checklist below.

**This vault (`~/Documents/emile-secondbrain/`) is the fix for the memory-fragmentation part**, not the missing-site-files part. Structure: a small `README.md` index + one file per topic, cross-linked with `[[wikilinks]]` — same pattern Claude Code's memory already used, just relocated somewhere both Code and (once connected) Cowork can reach, and Obsidian-browsable.

**Curated, not raw-dump.** Considered and rejected a PDF-guide approach (an Instagram lead-magnet from @alex2learn) that parses every Claude Code `.jsonl` session file into one markdown file per session (raw transcripts, tool calls included). Rejected because: (1) it scales to tens of MB of mostly noise per year, (2) the guide's own docs flag a real risk of leaked API keys sitting in old raw sessions, (3) it only covers Claude Code, not Cowork or claude.ai, (4) it isn't actually automatic either — needs a manual `/slay` sync command. Curated notes avoid all four: small, nothing goes in that wasn't deliberately written, works the same for any product that can read a folder, and Obsidian's graph view is actually *more* useful over ~40 meaningful topic nodes than over hundreds of raw session dumps.

**Mechanics — what's automatic vs. not:**
- **Claude Code:** auto-reads this vault's index at the start of every session (via a symlink from the original `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` path into this vault — see below). This part is native/automatic.
- **Cowork:** has no equivalent forced read. Only reads this vault if (a) the folder is explicitly connected to the session, and (b) a triggered skill's instructions say to read it first. This still needs to be written into Cowork's `duo-vert-ops` skill.
- **claude.ai chat:** no filesystem access at all — stays permanently manual (upload relevant files to Project knowledge).
- **Writing back:** neither product force-saves at session end. It only happens if the skill/instructions say to, and the update actually gets made before the session ends. Same risk as before, just relocated.

**Why the underlying Code memory files still physically live at `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`:** that exact path is hardcoded into how Claude Code auto-injects memory at session start — not something that can be redirected from inside a session. So the real files live in this vault, and symlinks at the original path point back here, keeping the auto-load working without duplicating content.

**Full website-build history migrated in 2026-07-30:** the old `duo-vert` Claude Code skill (design system, AI Studio prompt playbook, photo workflow, SEO audit history) was split into 5 topic files, now the source of truth — [[duo-vert/website-build-overview]], [[duo-vert/design-system]], [[duo-vert/ai-studio-playbook]], [[duo-vert/photo-workflow]], [[duo-vert/seo-history]].

**Still outstanding (Tasks-plugin format, added 2026-08-01 — installed the Obsidian Tasks plugin, converting this list to real trackable checkboxes instead of prose):**
- [x] `duovert-site-fixed` transferred from old computer ✅ 2026-08-01 — Emile uploaded to Google Drive; Claude Code pulled it via the Drive API, restored to `~/Documents/Duo Vert/duovert-site`, rebuilt `node_modules`, verified local preview (`npm run dev`, port 3000). Full detail in [[duo-vert/website-build-overview]].
- [ ] Paste the drafted read-bias + proactive-flagging Instructions text into all 8 of Emile's Cowork projects (separate from the `duo-vert-ops` skill file) — only the Duo Vert project has it applied so far via the GitHub-Context connection.
- [ ] Check whether Cowork has an account-level (not per-project) Memory/Personalization setting that could cover all 8 projects without connecting the GitHub repo to each individually — check under `Emile · Pro` account settings / Customize.

(Both items also tracked in [[project-current-todo-list]], Cowork rollout item.)

**Going forward:** every future Code/Cowork session working on Duo Vert should read this vault's `README.md` first, then write a short dated update to the relevant file at session end — this is how "what did we do 2 weeks ago" will keep working. Confirmed with Emile this is the expected behavior (2026-07-30).

**A separate automated "nightly consolidation" process also writes to this repo directly on GitHub (discovered 2026-08-31)** — visible in `git log` as commits like "Nightly consolidation: ..." roughly every 1-3 days since at least 2026-08-15, fixing stale relative-date phrasing, decaying day-counts, and dead cross-references, independent of any live Code/Cowork session. **This creates a real risk: if a local session's git repo goes uncommitted/unpushed for a while (happened 2026-08-15 → 2026-08-31, 16 days), the local working copy and the remote diverge into two separate lineages** — same files edited differently on each side, discovered only when a push gets rejected and a real `git merge` conflict has to be resolved by hand (happened 2026-08-31, see that date's commits). **How to apply:** don't assume a long-uncommitted local vault is safe to just overwrite/force-push — always `git fetch` + merge first, and actually read through merge conflicts rather than blindly picking one side, since the automated job may have caught real drift the local session never saw (e.g. it independently tracked 3 open to-do items — a client referral call, a Google LSA application, review-reply confirmation — that had been silently dropped from the local copy of [[project-current-todo-list]]). If pushes start failing again, this divergence is almost certainly why.

## Cowork read/write — resolved (2026-07-30 – 2026-08-01)

Vault connected to Cowork via the public GitHub repo `emilebusiness0/emile-secondbrain` (pushed manually via `git push` from Terminal — Cowork can't handle credentials).

**Read confirmed reliable** — works via a different available integration ("vibiz"), not Cowork's own web-fetch tool (which returned empty/failed). Verified genuine live pulls (not cache/hallucination) across 3 separate tests, including one where Cowork correctly reported facts added to the vault in that same session.

**Write confirmed impossible** — Cowork has no sandbox/shell environment (its "Code" tab is just a shortcut into Claude Code, not independent execution), so it can't `git push`. The in-chat folder-connect tool also doesn't persist across sessions.

**Resolution:** Cowork's `duo-vert-ops` skill (Cowork's own local copy, separate from this vault) drafts a copy-pasteable update in the chat reply at session end instead of attempting to write anywhere; Emile relays it into a Code session or edits the GitHub file directly — only needed for sessions that actually produced something worth remembering.
