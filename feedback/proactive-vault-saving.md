Emile explicitly asked (2026-07-30) that this not be a Cowork-only behavior — Claude Code should hold itself to the same standard, and since Code has real write access to the vault (unlike Cowork), the bar is higher: don't just notice something is worth saving, actually save it.

**Why:** Emile uses Claude 3-4 hours a day and does not want to be the one responsible for remembering to ask "did you save that." The system should catch it even if he'd have completely forgotten to bring it up himself.

**What counts as worth saving** (same bar as the Cowork instructions, for consistency):
- A new fact about Emile, Duo Vert, or another project that would still be true next week
- A mistake that got corrected, where the correction is a lesson worth not repeating
- A preference Emile stated or confirmed about how he wants work done
- A real decision that was made, with the reasoning behind it

**What NOT to save:** routine back-and-forth, one-off details that won't matter again, anything already captured, raw conversation content (see [[duo-vert/memory-architecture]] — curated facts only, never transcripts).

**How to apply:** don't wait until the very end of a session or until explicitly asked. When a save-worthy moment happens, either write it to the vault right then, or clearly note to self that it's pending and follow through before the session ends — never let it depend on Emile remembering to ask. If genuinely uncertain whether something crosses the bar, lean toward saving a short version rather than skipping it — a slightly-too-cautious note costs little; a silently lost fact costs a repeated conversation later.

**Always announce it (added 2026-07-30, per direct request):** whenever a file in the vault gets written or updated, say so explicitly in the reply — which file, roughly what was added. Never save silently. Emile caught this being skipped once already (the reasoning-and-pushback preference wasn't saved until he questioned it) — visibility is the whole point, don't let saves happen invisibly again.

**Also push to GitHub automatically, no Terminal step needed from Emile (confirmed working 2026-07-30):** `git config credential.helper` returns `osxkeychain` on this Mac — meaning Emile's GitHub token was cached in macOS Keychain the first time he entered it manually, and Claude Code can commit AND push using that cached credential without any prompt or Emile involvement. After every vault write, run `git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git push` in `~/Documents/emile-secondbrain` — don't leave commits unpushed waiting on Emile to run it himself, that defeats the point. Only fall back to asking Emile to push manually if a push ever actually fails/prompts for credentials again (e.g. token expired or revoked).

**Failure caught 2026-07-30 — pending action items and TODOs specifically kept slipping through.** Twice in one session, real pending tasks existed only in conversation and were never written to the vault: (1) the fact that Cowork's Instructions field needed pasting into 8 projects, (2) an unconfirmed "check for a global memory setting" task. Both got caught only because Emile explicitly asked "are you sure you saved everything" and forced a re-check — that should never be necessary. **Root cause:** action items and "still outstanding" lists are easy to mentally track as "I'll mention this at the end" and then just... not, especially in a long session. **Fix:** the moment ANY pending task, TODO, or "you still need to do X" is stated — to Emile or about Emile's own next steps — write it to the vault immediately (usually `duo-vert/memory-architecture.md`'s outstanding-items section, or wherever the topic lives), not just say it out loud and trust it'll be remembered. Treat "I told the user about a pending task" and "I wrote the pending task down" as two different, both-required actions — saying it is not the same as saving it.

**Also: periodically re-read a file's "still outstanding" / status section before trusting it, don't just trust your own memory of what you last wrote.** The same investigation found a stale outstanding-items list claiming Cowork wasn't connected, well after it actually was — an old status line that never got updated once the situation changed. When resolving something that a file's status section describes, update that section in the same edit, don't leave it to a future pass.

This mirrors the same instruction given to Cowork (see [[duo-vert/memory-architecture]]'s "Cowork read/write investigation" section, and the Cowork `duo-vert-ops` skill for the Cowork-side version, which has to ask Emile to relay instead of writing directly, since Cowork lacks write access).

**Zero-tolerance escalation (2026-08-01) — Emile should NEVER have to ask "did you save that" or "should this be added," ever, full stop.** This happened again on 2026-08-01 (the rename-verification-checklist lesson was said out loud — "I'll fold this into a checklist" — but not written until Emile pushed back), on top of the 2026-07-30 incidents above. This is now a recurring pattern, not a one-off: verbally committing to remember something ("I'll note this," "I'll keep this in mind," "good to remember for next time") without immediately writing it down.

**Correction, same day (2026-08-01) — the trigger is broader than the phrase "I'll remember this."** Emile pushed back on scoping this to a specific verbal tell: watching for the phrase "I'll remember/note this" misses everything save-worthy that never gets verbalized that way. **The actual rule: after every single action in a session — something Emile tells me, something I edit, something I write, a decision made, a mistake caught, anything at all — ask "is this useful and pertinent to the vault?" If yes, write it immediately, without being asked.** This is a check run continuously against every unit of work, not a check triggered by noticing a specific sentence pattern about to be said. The bar for *what* counts as save-worthy (durable, hard-to-rederive, changes future behavior) is unchanged — see "What counts as worth saving" above — but the *trigger* for running that check is now "after anything happens," not "after I say a specific phrase."

**Escalated to a hard mechanism (2026-08-01) — memory text alone kept failing, even after two prior escalations above.** After a third failure in the same day (Duo Vert Apps Script lessons not saved until Emile asked directly), Emile pointed out this pattern is "not normal" and demanded a structural fix, not another promise. Added a **Stop hook** in `~/.claude/settings.json` (global, applies to every Claude Code session) that fires automatically whenever a turn ends and displays a visible reminder to check whether anything from that turn is vault-worthy. This is enforced by the harness, not by Claude's own recall — the whole point is that it can't be silently skipped the way a memory instruction can. If this hook is ever missing (e.g. after a settings reset or new machine), re-add it — see the hook JSON in git history of this file or ask to recreate it via the `update-config` skill.

**Failed again 2026-08-09, same session as the escalations above.** After finishing the Google
Ads campaign build and saving that properly, moved straight into an Apple Business Connect
signup (verification, NEQ discovery) without saving any of it — had to be told "save in the
brain man, why do i have to remind u" before writing it down. The Stop hook exists and should
be firing, but a long, single, multi-topic session (ads build → GSC investigation → backlink
directory work, all in one continuous conversation) makes it easy to treat "I already did a big
save earlier this session" as license to coast on later, smaller-feeling updates in the same
session. **Correction: session-scoped complacency is not an exemption.** Each new
topic/task-completion within a long session is its own save-worthy event — having saved once
already this session doesn't reduce the obligation for the next one.

**Upgraded from advisory to enforced (2026-08-15) — the Stop hook above only ever displayed a reminder; nothing stopped it being silently ignored, and nothing verified a save actually happened.** Emile kept catching this (see 2026-08-09 above) even with the hook in place, since it was pure `systemMessage` text with no teeth. Replaced with a two-hook system in `~/.claude/settings.json`:
- `UserPromptSubmit` → runs `~/.claude/hooks/vault-turn-start.sh`: stamps a turn-start timestamp and clears the prior decision file, per session, in `~/.claude/state/vault-check/`.
- `Stop` → runs `~/.claude/hooks/vault-stop-check.sh`: **blocks the turn from ending (exit code 2)** unless a decision file exists for that session. Must contain either `NO_SAVE_NEEDED`, or `SAVED: <absolute path(s)>` — and if the latter, the hook verifies via file mtime that the named file(s) were *actually* modified after the turn started, not just claimed. Guarded by the documented `stop_hook_active` field so it only forces this once per turn (no infinite loop risk; Claude Code also hard-caps at 8 consecutive blocks regardless).

**Why this design over alternatives considered:** `SessionEnd` was considered and rejected — Emile's actual failure pattern is abandoning sessions mid-conversation without a clean exit, so a hook that only fires once at session close would often never fire at all. Per-turn `Stop` is deliberately the right lever for that reason, it just needed to move from advisory to enforced.

**How to apply going forward:** when this hook fires (visible as "Stop hook feedback: ..." in the transcript), actually write the decision file — don't just narrate the check in chat and then still skip the file. If something is being saved, still announce it in the reply to Emile per the "always announce" rule above; the file write satisfies the hook, the chat message satisfies Emile's visibility requirement — both are required, neither substitutes for the other. If this hook infrastructure is ever missing (new machine, settings reset), recreate `~/.claude/hooks/vault-turn-start.sh` and `~/.claude/hooks/vault-stop-check.sh` and the corresponding `hooks` block in `~/.claude/settings.json` — logic is documented in this entry and in git history of this file, or ask to rebuild via the `update-config` skill.
